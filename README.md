# OpenQiskitOS

A bootable Linux ISO for quantum computing â€” no pip hell, no broken kernels. Just circuits.

OpenQiskitOS includes:
- Python 3.11
- Qiskit 2.x (preinstalled)
- JupyterLab 4.x
- A prewired virtual environment (`qiskit_env_arm64`)
- A one-touch launch script: `start_q.sh`

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Flash the ISO to a USB drive  
2. Boot into the live environment (Default password:qiskit) 
3. Wait for `start_q.sh` to auto run

Thatâ€™s it. JupyterLab will launch and you're ready to build quantum circuits.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots and ISO download coming soon.
